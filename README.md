just a fun project, till i get hired.

you need SDL2 to compile this.
works on linux. dont have money to test on mac. god bless if you are using windows.

gcc snake.c `sdl2-config --cflags --libs`


if you are willing to contribute,
    - berry location generation is not efficient (when snake is long)
    - speed is not incremented after eating a berry
    - no scoreboard. HAIYAAAA
