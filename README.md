# Snake Game 

Just a fun project until I get hired.  

**You need SDL2 to compile this.**  
Works on Linux. Don’t have money to test on Mac.  
God bless if you are using Windows.  

Compile & run:

```bash
gcc snake.c `sdl2-config --cflags --libs`
./a.out

if you are willing to contribute, 
- berry location generation is not efficient (when snake is long) 
- speed is not incremented after eating a berry
- no scoreboard. HAIYAAAA
